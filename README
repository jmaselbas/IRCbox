IRCbox
-------

IRCbox is a true suckless IRC client, it runs on the barebox bootloader
with the addition of a stupid TCP implementation. This is for the adept
that seek the true IRC experience, without any compromises. Forget all
distractions and embrace the true nature of IRC: join and chat with the
vast and infinite wired.

Building
--------

Right now the easier way to test this is to run barebox on qemu for aarch64.
For this you will need two things, first an aarch64 toolchaine, secondly
qemu-system-aarch64

```
CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- ARCH=arm make O=build_irc/ ircbox_defconfig all
```

Running
-------

In order to have access to the internet from qemu you will need to setup
a new tap interface, this is setup example:

```
sudo ip tuntap add tap0 mode tap
sudo ip addr add 172.0.0.1/24 dev tap0
sudo ip link set tap0 up
sudo /bin/sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE -o YOUR_OUTPUT_INTERFACE_OF_CHOICE
```

Run qemu with the built barebox image:
```
$ qemu-system-aarch64 -m 256M -M virt -cpu cortex-a57 -nographic -serial mon:stdio -kernel build_irc/images/barebox-dt-2nd.img -device virtio-net-device,netdev=network0 -netdev tap,id=network0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript
```

Connecting
----------

From the barebox shell run the `irc` command like so:

```
barebox@ARM QEMU virt64:/ irc -n mynick irc.libera.chat
```

Commands
--------

 - `/j #chan` join a channel named `#chan`
 - `/l` leave a channel
 - `/q` quit
 - `/w` whisper someone text` whisper `text` to `someone` (equivalent of `/query`)
 - `/m` send a ACTION emote (same a `/me`)
 - `/NICK newnick` change your nickname to `newnick`
